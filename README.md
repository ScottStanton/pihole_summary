# pihole_summary
This is a webpage to show stats for multiple piholes on one webpage.

It's not normal to make webpages like this, but I am using it as a way to learn python.  Feel free to take the idea and make it in a different format.
If you are good at making a web page look good, feel free to fork this and make it look better, just please let me know about it.
